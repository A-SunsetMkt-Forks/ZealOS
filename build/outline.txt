Auto-ISO Host QEMU Build Distro ISO for VM Install:
	Process:
		- make new HDD for a quick install
		- boot AUTO.ISO with hdd
			- do mini-install and then reboot w/ mount hdd then copy src/-->hdd
			- reboot, recompile kernel, reboot, run K.CC with DoDistro
		(- copy hdd-->src maybe? not "needed" to just make the Distro ISO)
		- export Distro.ISO to Host
		- delete temp HDD, finish
		
Auto-ISO:
	Required Stages/Steps:
		- automatically installs to first identified hard disk. 
			- this could maybe just mimic how current VM install works,
				just don't bother asking any questions for user input.
		- copy src over hdd
		- reboot (TO HDD), recompile Kernel, reboot, run K.CC-->DoDistro
		- export Distro.ISO to src/
		- poweroff, done.

	Thoughts:
		- implement a "GOOD" file somewhere that is made at the end,
			check for this after running the auto ISO and bail if not found?

	Notes:
		- the Auto HDD bootloader will need to change.
			it has to auto-boot into the C Drive to do this process...
			so removing&skipping the prompt will be required
